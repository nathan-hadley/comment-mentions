# CommentMentions

CommentMentions is an Angular component that facilitates user interactions by allowing them to mention other users in comments, similar to how you would on popular social media platforms. By typing "@" followed by a username, the system provides autocomplete suggestions. Users mentioned in submitted comments are then alerted.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.3.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and the Angular CLI installed on your machine. If not, you can install them using the following commands:

``````
# Install Node.js
Visit https://nodejs.org/ and download the installer.

# Install Angular CLI globally
npm install -g @angular/cli
``````

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
